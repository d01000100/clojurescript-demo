# Clojurescript Demo

Simple front-end battleship game made with clojurescript

## Overview

Simple showcase of a clojurescript tool using reagent, which uses React.

To compile you must have [clojure](https://clojure.org/community/downloads) and [leiningen](https://leiningen.org/#install) installed.

You simply clone, and run `lein figwheel`. This will run the development environment and the REPL.

You can also download the [release](https://github.com/d01000100/clojurescript-demo/releases) to see the game working.
